Hi, I'm Stormizinhu and i am a big fan 
of Mega Man so i developed this alerts 
based on Mega Man X Dialogue Box.

Just set you "Alert", "Amount" and
"Message" Messsages, with their own
possible Variables as you wish.

You can set Audio, Image and Video for 
each one (None, Image or Video).
Alto the alerts Duration and Delay.

30 colors to choose (the first 6 ones is 
from X - X3, than i created another 8 
and the others 16 is from Mega Man X8 Demake).

Now it has TTS support! Choose if you
want it active, one of various languages 
and variations and it's volume.

Feel free to ask me anything.
